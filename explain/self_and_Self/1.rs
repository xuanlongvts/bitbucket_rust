/*
In Rust, self and Self mean two difference things.

self refers to the current module or object.
Self refers to the type of the current module or object.

One of the examples that clarifies this difference is the implementation of PartialEq. 
Letâ€™s imagine that we want to implement PartialEq for an struct.

------------
Self, with a capital "S", is used to refer to the implementing type within traits and implementations.

Self can only be used as the first segment, without a preceding ::.
