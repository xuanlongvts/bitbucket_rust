Here is a recap of the reasons to choose Box<T>, Rc<T>, or RefCell<T>:

- Rc<T> enables multiple owners of the same data; Box<T> and RefCell<T> have single owners.
- Box<T> allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at compile time; Rc<T> allows only immutable borrows checked at compile time; 
- RefCell<T> allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at runtime.
- Because RefCell<T> allows mutable borrows checked at runtime, you can mutate the value inside the RefCell<T> even when the RefCell<T> is immutable.
