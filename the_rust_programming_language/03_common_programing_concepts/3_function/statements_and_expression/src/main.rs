/*
Note the x + 1 line without a semicolon at the end, which is unlike most of the lines youâ€™ve seen so far.
Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement,
which will then not return a value. Keep this in mind as you explore function return values and expressions next.
